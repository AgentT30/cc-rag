    "### What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for retrieval augmented generation. It's a process where the user question is first used to retrieve the information, then both the question and the retrieved information is passed to an LLM as context. It allows AI models to access and use external information to improve their responses. It combines the power of large language models with the ability to retrieve relevant data, making their outputs more accurate, informative, and up-to-date.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below is the high level representation of how a RAG system works.\n",

    "### Why RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM'sare highly effective at processing and generating general information but may lack specialized domain expertise. Additionally, their knowledge is typically limited to information available up to their training cutoff date, rendering them unable to address events or updates that occurred thereafter. However, by providing relevant and context-specific data, these models can be equipped with the necessary domain knowledge to respond effectively to specialized queries. Think of it like having an AI assistant that can quickly look up facts or consult expert sources before giving you an answer. This makes the AI more reliable and helpful, especially when dealing with specific topics or needing the latest information.\n",
